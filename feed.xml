				<![CDATA[
				<p>April marked a return to full capacity, and it kept me quite busy! I started with a new issue of my quarterly zine, HOLY!</p>

				<p>CW: surgery</p>
				<p>March started with a surprise surgery followed by a month of recovery time, so I wasn't able to make a lot of new work. That said, I did begin releasing individual cards from the <a href="https://helveticablanc.bigcartel.com/product/the-wormsong-oracle-deck" target="_blank">Wormsong Oracle Deck</a> as prints, so that'll be something nice to follow along with for most of this year! Here are the prints released this month:</p>
				<p>
					<a href="20250317-the-messenger.html">
						<img src="img/digital/20250317-the-messenger.png" alt="A Seeker rides a human-faced horse while carrying a long, black banner. Two other Seekers follow behind on foot, conversing. The background is a field of red with some collaged sheet music throughout." loading="lazy"><br/>The Messenger
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="20250324-the-seer.html">
						<img src="img/digital/20250324-the-seer.png" alt="A Seeker communicates with a star-like entity in an asemic language beneath an archway made of organic, mushroom-like shapes." loading="lazy"><br/>The Seer
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>As a little bonus, here's a sketch from my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/helveticablanc" target="_blank">weekly Patreon sketches</a>. I've been enjoying starting sketch sessions with Kīrolisks, because they so easily build upon my practice of asemic drawing.</p>

				<![CDATA[
				<p>February was busy with a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff, but I managed to make a couple of worm-themed pieces (amusingly, I'm typing this during March's <a href="https://www.almanac.com/content/full-moon-march" target="_blank">Worm Moon</a>)! The first is the Dreamer from my ongoing project, Wormsong:</p>
				<p>
					<a href="20250203-hymn-1.html">
						<img src="img/digital/20250203-hymn-1.png" alt="A massive, star-headed worm wraps around the Realms, haloed by a rainbow. The border is filled with lesser worms representing the vowels in Wormrōte, tree branches, and the symbol for Wormwood. A label adorns the panel in Wormrōte, reading 'All hail the Dreamer'." loading="lazy"><br/>Hymn 1
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>The second is the worm from <a href="https://pseudonymjones.com/" target="_blank">Pseudonym Jones'</a> webcomic, <a href="https://wiarg.pseudonymjones.com/" target="_blank">worm-in-a-rock god</a>:</p>
				<p>
					<a href="20250219-wiarg.html">
						<img src="img/digital/20250219-wiarg.png" alt="The titular god, a worm with their head inside of a rock, leaving a single eye visible. Behind them are a moon and star, and a halo crowns the head while tears stream from their eye. The halo has a Wormrōte inscription repeating 'creation, destruction', and more Wormrōte can be seen at the bottom that reads 'worm in a rock god'." loading="lazy"><br/>wiarg

			<title>HOLY! 26, Goblin Week, and Shop Launch</title>
			<link>http://www.helveticablanc.com/updates-2025.html#20250213</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
				<p>January was a packed month, with a lot of stuff to share with y'all! First up is the new zine, <a href="https://helveticablanc.itch.io/holy-26" target="_blank">HOLY! 26</a>:</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://helveticablanc.itch.io/holy-26" target="_blank"><img src="img/zines/holy-26.png" alt="Cover of HOLY! 26" loading="lazy"></a>
				</p>
				<p>Next up are the three pieces I made for Goblin Week (the last full week of January, for those who celebrate):</p>
				<p>
					<a href="20250115-eris-5.html"><img src="img/digital/20250115-eris-5.png" alt="Five multi-colored goblins dance around a bird-headed goddess. She holds a crown, coins, and scissors that cut a red thread which bound her. Above her is text in Wormrōte which reads 'The Goblin Queen'." loading="lazy"><br/>Eris 5</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="20250122-dance-2.html"><img src="img/digital/20250122-dance-2.png" alt="Seven green goblins recreate the Danse Macabre, with Death in the lead. Behind them are three skeletal goblins, and three others wearing the hats of a pope, a king, and a laborer. The first behind Death holds aloft a flag while the last plays a horn." loading="lazy"><br/>Dance 2</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="20250125-dance-3.html"><img src="img/digital/20250125-dance-3.png" alt="Seven red goblins fight one another with swords and scythes around a staircase and archway in ruins. Wormrōte on an archway reads 'The Three-in-One demands blood'." loading="lazy"><br/>Dance 3</a>
				</p>
				<p>Finally &mdash; after two years of work, I'm happy to say that the Wormsong Oracle Deck is complete and <a href="https://helveticablanc.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">up for sale on my brand new shop</a> (along with a few other fun things)!</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://helveticablanc.bigcartel.com/product/the-wormsong-oracle-deck" target="_blank"><img src="img/updates/20250213.jpg" alt="A promotional shot of the Wormsong Oracle Deck, featuring the box and a spread of cards." loading="lazy"></a>
				</p>
				<p>For now, the <a href="https://helveticablanc.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Helvetica Blanc Shop</a> is shipping within the US only, since international shipping is currently a mess and really expensive. Hopefully I can find some solutions for international folks with time.</p>
				<p>I told y'all it was a busy month!</p>

				<![CDATA[
				<p>December brought one final traditional piece for the year — Sigil 14. Happy New Year, everyone!</p>
				<p><a href="202412-sigil-14.html"><img src="img/traditional/202412-sigil-14.jpg" alt="A geometric, many-faced, many-legged entity struggles to climb a hill composed of sheet music collage.

				Again<br/>

				<![CDATA[
				<p>November was a busy month behind the scenes, but I finished a new traditional piece accompanied by a poem — Sigil 13.</p>
				<p><a href="202411-sigil-13.html"><img src="img/traditional/202411-sigil-13.jpg" alt="An entity with a horned bovine head, wings, and three arms gestures toward a small sigil that they appear to have drawn with a quill. Above them, a golden halo is surrounded by a faint labyrinth, and music from a hymnal is collaged in the background. Below the sigil is text in Wormrōte that reads 'There is no wisdom in my path'." loading="lazy"><br/>Sigil 13</a></p>
				<p>There is no wisdom<br/>
				in my path;<br/>
				descent t'ward<br/>
				frozen wings beating<br/>
				against a<br/>
				still colder cage</p>
