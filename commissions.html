	<h1>Commissions</h1>

	<main>
		<p>I'm currently fully booked, but should be available again in late 2024. Email me at <a href="mailto:helveticablanc@gmail.com">helveticablanc@gmail.com</a> to be added to the waitlist!</p>
		<h3>What to Expect</h3>
		<ol class="no-bottom">
			<li>Reach out to me via email and describe your project. If you have references from my own work or elsewhere, samples of your work, etc &mdash; bring it on! I'll provide a quote based on the size of the project, licensing needs, and required files, as well as an estimated start date.</li>
			<li>Just before that start date, I'll reach out to find if you're still available. When I have confirmation of your availability, I'll draft an agreement for us to sign and send you a Paypal invoice for the first 50% of the project fee. If I don't hear from you within two weeks, I'll move on to the next client on the waitlist and we'll fit you in at a later date!</li>
			<li>Once the agreement is signed and the invoice paid for, I'll take some time to sketch out 2-3 rough concepts. After a direction is decided on, we'll go through a few rounds of adjustments, polishing, etc. That's when the magic happens!</li>
			<li>When we're both happy with the piece, I'll prepare files for export and delivery while you pay a final Paypal invoice for the remainder of the fee. And then we're done! Be sure to tag me on social media when your project goes live so I can boost you!</li>
