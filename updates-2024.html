		<h2>Low &amp; Slow</h2>
		<p>I've been on a hiatus from making prints since December, which has given me time to focus primarily on the Oracle Deck, Collector's Cards, and client commissions. It's also given me the mental space to do some worldbuilding for future Wormsong updates, as well as simply sitting and allowing new stuff to bubble up. That's what you can see with my sketches lately &ndash; a lot of bubbling.</p>
		<p>The cauldron isn't boiling yet, but it's working its way there. My plan is to update this feed monthly alongside my <a href="https://buttondown.email/helveticablanc" target="_blank">email newsletter</a>, and then weekly or bi-weekly when I start releasing new prints again. For the most detailed, cutting-edge updates, there's always <a href="https://www.patreon.com/helveticablanc" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>

		<h2>Formatting</h2>
		<p>Along with a new feed comes a new format! I'm going to continue providing updates here whether I make a new print or not, and since updates are always a little nicer with some art, most weeks I'll include a sketch. For those who want more, I usually post a handful of sketches along with oracle deck updates weekly over on my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/helveticablanc" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>
		<p>Finally, I have a new, commissioned variant of the font <a href="https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/basteleur/" target="_blank">Basteleur</a> throughout my website, so feel free to browse around and check out those letterforms!</p>
		<p>Thanks to all my RSS friends for your feedback on the formatting, and never hesitate to lemme know if something looks awry!</p>

		<h2>New Year, New Feed</h2>
		<p>It's a new year, and while I'm still taking a break from new prints, I thought I'd try making my update feed a little nicer, including putting a backlog of my update posts on their own page.</p>
		<p>For my RSS folks: lemme know how things look on your end, and I appreciate your patience as I slowly troubleshoot any issues!</p>
		<p>In the meanwhile, enjoy these offerings for Eris I've been making to start the day.</p>
