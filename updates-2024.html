		<h2>Sigil 11 and Magic Cards</h2>
		<p>September was a busy month behind the scenes, but I managed to complete a new traditional piece!</p>
		<p><a href="202409-sigil-11.html"><img src="img/traditional/202409-sigil-11.jpg" alt="A two-headed, weeping serpent shapes itself to form an archway.

		<p>I'm also excited to announce a new set of cards for Magic: The Gathering! You can find them as part of the newest Secret Lair drop &mdash; <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/product/1018463/tome-of-the-astral-sorceress" target="_blank">Tome of the Astral Sorceress</a>!</p>

		<h2>Sigils 8-10</h2>
		<p>August found me hard at work editing the upcoming oracle deck, as well as wrapping up a few small traditional pieces. My experiments with casein will continue for a little while longer!</p>

		<h2>HOLY! 24 and Sigils 6-7</h2>
		<p>July saw the release of HOLY! 24, which marks a shift for the zine series. Since I'm making far fewer sketches and studies, the majority of this zine now documents my ink offerings. I hope you enjoy seeing them as they progress!</p>
		<p><a href="https://helveticablanc.itch.io/holy-24" target="_blank"><img src="img/zines/holy-24.png" alt="Cover of HOLY! 24" loading="lazy"></a></p>
		<p>I also finished a couple new traditional pieces that use casein paint &mdash; Sigils 6 and 7 &mdash; and they're teaching me a lot about the medium!</p>
		<p><a href="202407-sigil-6.html"><img src="img/traditional/202407-sigil-6.jpg" alt="A large black cross dominates the composition, with a cross-like sigil scratched into the center.

		<h2>Making Things</h2>
		<p>I'm making a small adjustment to what's covered in these updates &mdash; covering what's been released in the previous month instead of up to whatever arbitrary Friday I'm able to write the catch-up. So for this July update, I'll recap what's been released in June!</p>
		<p>Aside from the <a href="updates-2024.html#20240614">Magic: The Gathering card</a> released in early June, much of the month was spent working on longer-term projects. I did, however, get to make a not-so-terrible comic for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pseudonymjones.bsky.social/post/3kvnfejfcju2u" target="_blank">#makeaterriblecomicday2024</a>:</p>
		<p><a href="20240624-make-something.html"><img src="img/digital/20240624-make-something.png" alt="A nine-panel page of a crown-of-thorns-shaped angel saying 'if you want to make something big, first make something small and something small and something small'. Each panel shows a drop of red liquid slowly filling up the panels until they overflow. Sigils decorate the page throughout, and at the bottom is some Wormrōte script that reads 'make something'." loading="lazy"><br/>
		Make Something</a></p>
		<p>It's a bit of advice I really needed, and I hope you find it useful, too!</p>

		<h2>Ayy, I'm Makin' Magic (The Gathering) Over Here</h2>
		<p>This month brings a new traditional piece and a couple exciting client projects. First, the traditional:</p>
		<p><a href="https://helveticablanc.com/202405-sigil-5.html"><img src="img/traditional/202405-sigil-5.jpg" alt="A three-winged, many-eyed angel resembling a crown of thorns hovers above a black tower. Near it, a Wormrōte sigil reads 'A Slow-Moving Tower of Babel'. Behind them, a faint collage of hymns can be seen in the background, and various details such as sigils are gilded in silver and gold leaf." loading="lazy"><br/>
		Sigil 5 (A Slow-Moving Tower of Babel)</a></p>
		<p>I'm really pleased with how my traditional work is progressing, and I'm excited to see what the next month brings. Until then, I've got some client work to share. The first is for another <a href="https://merveilles.town/@bd" target="_blank">Merveilles</a> resident, <a href="https://badd10de.dev/" target="_blank">Bad Diode.</a></p>
		<p><a href="https://badd10de.dev/" target="_blank"><img src="img/commissions/bad-diode.png" alt="An album cover for Bad Diode. A geometric, many-winged, angelic entity resembling Bad Diode's logo reaches down towards a monolith bearing Bad Diode's name in Wormrōte." loading="lazy"></a></p>
		<p>The second announcement is that I got to make a card for the <a href="https://magic.gg/news/qualify-for-pro-tour-2-in-2025-and-earn-sweet-full-art-secret-lair-prize" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering Regional Championships!</a> The card will be available to all participants, and I'm so honored to have a small part in it.</p>

		<h2>HOLY! 23 &amp; Sigils 1-4</h2>
		<p>There's no new Wormsong this month on account of me being ill most of April. That said, <a href="https://helveticablanc.itch.io/holy-23" target="_blank">HOLY! 23</a> is up, and collects a ton of sketches from January through March.</p>

		<p>While being away from the computer, I've gotten back into making work traditionally after a couple years off. There's something satisfying about making physical work, and it's given me a chance to lean into my rougher, more prehistoric influences. I've added a <a href="https://helveticablanc.com/traditional.html">new section on my website</a> to archive it, and here's the first four pieces:</p>
		<a href="https://helveticablanc.com/202404-sigil-1.html"><img src="img/traditional/202404-sigil-1.jpg" alt="A mixed media piece composed of acrylic paint, charcoal, graphite, collage, and gold leaf.

		Sigil 1 (Small Changes to Prevent Large Ones)</a></p>

A faint collage of hymns and pencil sigils are scattered in the background, and the edges of the panel are gilt in gold leaf." loading="lazy"><br/>

		<p><a href="https://helveticablanc.com/202405-sigil-4.html"><img src="img/traditional/202405-sigil-4.jpg" alt="A Wormrōte sigil meaning 'blessing' sits between the horns of a black Auroch.

Expect another entry soon, and that's when things will really get going! We're still just at the beginning, so I'm making an effort to figure out what kind of realistic publishing schedule I might have. Expect about one entry a month, and hopefully as I wrap up some projects, I may be able to bump that to two.

		<p>It's mid-quarter, and that means a <a href="https://helveticablanc.itch.io/holy-22" target="_blank">new issue of HOLY! is available!</a> This one covers the last prints before my hiatus, and has a ton of visual development sketches for the Nōr.</p>
		<p>I've also added a <a href="tools-and-methods.html">Tools &amp; Methods</a> page to the site recently. I figure it might give y'all some more insight into my work, and the list of tools may be useful.</p>

I've uploaded the whole parade as a <a href="https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/helveticablanc/" target="_blank">print</a>, as well as individual prints for each goblin.</p>
		<p>There's something very funny about saying that I'll be continuing my hiatus from making prints, and then immediately making some. But it's <a href="https://goblinweek.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Goblin Week</a>, and I can never resist!</p>

		<h2>Low &amp; Slow</h2>
		<p>I've been on a hiatus from making prints since December, which has given me time to focus primarily on the Oracle Deck, Collector's Cards, and client commissions. It's also given me the mental space to do some worldbuilding for future Wormsong updates, as well as simply sitting and allowing new stuff to bubble up. That's what you can see with my sketches lately &ndash; a lot of bubbling.</p>
		<p>The cauldron isn't boiling yet, but it's working its way there. My plan is to update this feed monthly alongside my <a href="https://buttondown.email/helveticablanc" target="_blank">email newsletter</a>, and then weekly or bi-weekly when I start releasing new prints again. For the most detailed, cutting-edge updates, there's always <a href="https://www.patreon.com/helveticablanc" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>

		<h2>Formatting</h2>
		<p>Along with a new feed comes a new format! I'm going to continue providing updates here whether I make a new print or not, and since updates are always a little nicer with some art, most weeks I'll include a sketch. For those who want more, I usually post a handful of sketches along with oracle deck updates weekly over on my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/helveticablanc" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>
		<p>Finally, I have a new, commissioned variant of the font <a href="https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/basteleur/" target="_blank">Basteleur</a> throughout my website, so feel free to browse around and check out those letterforms!</p>
		<p>Thanks to all my RSS friends for your feedback on the formatting, and never hesitate to lemme know if something looks awry!</p>

		<p>For my RSS folks: lemme know how things look on your end, and I appreciate your patience as I slowly troubleshoot any issues!</p>
		<p>In the meanwhile, enjoy these offerings for Eris I've been making to start the day.</p>
